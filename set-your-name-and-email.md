## Here's How to Tell Git Your Name and Email

```
git config --global user.name "Jeff Haemer"
git config --global user.email jshaemer@twitter.com
```

This has ___nothing___ to do with permissions.
This is to give you credit (or blame) for your own commits.
If you don't do this, Git will yell at you.
